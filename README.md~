### Overview ###

This project consists in a data exploration related to daily exercises.

The idea here is to import the data source from Health Graph API provided by Runkeeper company. After load the necessary data,
we´ll perform an exploratory study to get statistics related to training performance, geolocation, ranking the bests and worsts
trainings by category (e.g: running, cycling, walking etc), and to conclude we´ll try to get information from user´s friends
applying web scraping techniques.
